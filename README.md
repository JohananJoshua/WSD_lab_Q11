Lab Ex:11 Implement CRUD Operation using ReactJs.

Basic task management application using React. The application should allow users to add tasks, view a list of tasks, edit task details, and delete tasks.

Create a React component called TaskList to display a list of tasks.
Implement a form component for adding new tasks.
Allow users to edit the details of existing tasks.
Implement a feature to delete tasks.
Ensure that the task list updates in real-time as users perform CRUD operations.

Use useState or useReducer for managing the task list's state.
Consider adding validation for task inputs (e.g., task name cannot be empty).
Style the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
